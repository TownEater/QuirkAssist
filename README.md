# QuirkAssist
A tool for typing like the characters from Homestuck.

This project was created over a decade ago, and has been uploaded to this repository for archival purposes. In that time, the original places it was hosted have become defunct or difficult to use. It is my hope that anyone who is interested in this software will find this repository useful.

Build instructions have been lost to time. This was created using AutoHotKey, which as of this writing is still a maintained tool.

Head over to [releases](https://github.com/TownEater/QuirkAssist/releases) for the download.
